## Project

Using Machine Learning we developed a system where we can train agents to partake in a simple fetch quest, as well as train opponents to add a challenge to this mechanic.

For a first phase we implemented our own version of the Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning algorithm. We also implemented the same system using [Unity's ML Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) to compare to our own implementation.
